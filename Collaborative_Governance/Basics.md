**The Oxford Handbook of Governance**  

## What?  
- A strategy / a technique  
- Who collaborates; who sponsors collaboration; what the term collaboration means; how collaboration is organized  

## Types  
- **Collaborative Planning**  
- **Watershed Councils**  
  - Watersheds transcend political jurisdictions and contain many different stakeholders.  
  - Stakeholder partnership, representatives from private interest groups, local public agencies, and state or federal agencies.  
  - Three types of watershed partnerships: citizen-based; agency-based; and mixed groups.  
  - A group of activities: restoration, monitoring, integrated planning, education, and advocacy.  
- **Regulatory Negotiation**  
  - Traditional notice-and-comment rule  
  - Command-and-control regulation; experiment  

## As Democratic Reconstruction  
- A different style of democratic engagement with citizens  
- **To whom:** individuals, organizations, and communities  
- **Impact:** information, service, capacity  

- Adversarial or managerial approaches to democracy  
- **Managerialism**: an emphasis on the primacy of experts and expertise in decision-making, with the goal of keeping agencies free from political influence and corruption.  
- The more politicized and adversarial decision-making becomes, the stronger the incentive to buffer some decisions from politics.  
- **Collaborative Governance (CG)** seeks to reconstruct both sides of this relationship: opposing stakeholders find areas of consensus or compromise; making the process more open to direct public input.  

1. An extension of **"Alternative Dispute Resolution" (ADR)** (p.503)  
2. A form of **"democratic problem-solving"**, which reconstructs managerialism by engaging broader publics in the policy-making process. (p.504)  
   - **"Horizontal" capacity** of community groups to engage in problem-solving  
3. A **"partnership"**  
   - Regarding the fragmentation of public management, collaborative **"partnerships"** facilitate interagency cooperation and "joined-up" government. (p.504)  
   - **Partnership** signifies a mechanism for expanding public engagement in policy-making. (p.504)  
   - Partnership enables different people and organizations to support each other by leveraging, combining, and capitalizing on their complementary strengths and capabilities. (p.504) *[U-G cites]*  
4. **"Democratic Experimentalism" and "Empowered Participatory Governance"**  
   - A direct and expanded role for citizen deliberation in administration and policy-making; accountability.  

## Process Outcomes  
- **Attempts to collaborate are often fraught with opportunities for failure.** (p.505)  
- **"Process outcomes"**: whether collaborative processes actually succeed at becoming collaborative. (p.505)  
- Whether agencies and non-state stakeholders are actually committed to the collaborative process.  
- **Key factors:** leadership, trust.  
- **Eight principles (Siriani, 2009):**  
  - Citizens should coproduce public goods.  
  - Community assets should be mobilized.  
  - Expert knowledge should be shared.  
  - Citizens should deliberate together.  
  - Partnerships should be encouraged to be sustainable.  
  - Assets and governance networks should be strategically mobilized and deployed.  
  - Institutional cultures should be transformed to support collaboration.  
  - Mutual accountability among collaborative partners should be ensured.  

## Evaluating Collaborative Governance  
- **Criteria:**  
  - Success in reaching an agreement.  
  - Efficiency of the collaborative process relative to alternative processes.  
  - Satisfaction of stakeholders with the process and the outcome.  
  - Achievement of other **"social capital"** benefits.
