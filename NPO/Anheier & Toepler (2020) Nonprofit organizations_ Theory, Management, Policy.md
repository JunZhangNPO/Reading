### Part IV: Policy and Current Developments

#### Chapter 16: State-Nonprofit Relations

**Summary**  
The relationship patterns between the state and government can be divided into: supplementary, complementary, adversarial, and collaborative (Young & Casey, 2017; Toepler, 2019). The government has strong support in the healthcare industries.

**Quote**  
- System of third-party government (p. 523)  
- The division of labor in providing collective goods (p. 523)

**Questions**  
1. What's the difference between "relation" and "relationship"?
2. Can "data-driven" be defined as a process of commercialization?

**Thoughts**  
This chapter also includes a section about commercialization, which I am interested in. The author uses "for-profit encroachment into nonprofit fields of operation" to describe this process. This phenomenon leads to changes in the labor market, such as a "wage penalty." Additionally, government funders attach more importance to performance and capacity measures in contracting relationships. However, there is a concern about nonprofits adopting business-like management strategies, which can sacrifice social benefits. In other articles, this sacrifice is defined as "mission drift." Therefore, nonprofits are embedded in the organizational field. Their business-like behavior can influence the market and government sectors. When we consider the business-like media image of nonprofits, the audience is an important stakeholder but not the only one.

**Critique**  
The concept of "commercialization" defines the introduction of performance orientation, facilitating the entrance of commercial providers into traditional nonprofit domains. However, it mainly discusses management orientation in the following section. The commercialization of government contracting does not equate to having more private contractors or nonprofits being commercialized.
