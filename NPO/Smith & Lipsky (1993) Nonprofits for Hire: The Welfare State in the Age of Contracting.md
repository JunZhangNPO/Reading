Part I
** Contracting for Services in the Welfare State 
- More dependence on nonprofit organizations means not less but more government involvement in the affairs of voluntary and community agencies. p5


Professionalization
**The Impact on Nonprofits 
- The result is higher service costs, reduced services, and a distancing of the client from the organization. p100
- Reuuced potential for advocacy p100
- Lead to more conventional social service approach p100
- Professionals insulate their organizations from accountability. It will be difficult to achieve public accountability where professionals dominate organizations. p100
- Three factors: professional standards in service areas; increased government regulations and changes in client pool.
*Professionalization and Specialization
- Government funding of nonproft social welfare agencies often contributes to existing tendencies among nonprofit organizations toward professionalization and specialization.
- Facilitating professionalization: use government funding to expand services, offer higher pay, and hire more skilled staff. p104
- Requiring professionalization: professional staffing levels
- Professionalization as advantage in seeking contracts: competition, commanding the expertise, professional licensing as a tactic, such as mental
health clinic status; it gives government administrators greater confidence in the legtimacy of the service contract; nonprofits ise professional capacity to protect their share of the contract market. 
  
The individuals who now bring into reality the service side of the welfare state are the new street-level bureaucrats. p115
