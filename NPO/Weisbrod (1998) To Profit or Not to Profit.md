**What to Focus On**
- If we write a book about the commercialization of nonprofits, what should we discuss?  
- What, why, how, so what: different stages, forms, degrees, and sectors  
- **Finance**: taxes, revenue  
- **Legal issues**: registration status  
- **Output and impact**: services, mission  
- **Management**: human resources, leadership, strategy  
- **External partnerships**: collaboration, relationships with businesses and governments  
- **attraction**: donation, volunteer, funding 
  
**Questions**
