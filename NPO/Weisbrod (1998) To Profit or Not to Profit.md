**Foreword**
- Profit-making and nonprofit firms  
- Commercialization of nonprofit firms  
- Motivation: competing with for-profits; pressure from insiders to capitalize on value; desire to expand; reduction in outside support  
- Hard-to-define objectives  
- Extant but growing in significance  

**What to Focus On**
- If we write a book about the commercialization of nonprofits, what should we discuss?  
- What, why, how, so what: different stages, forms, degrees, and sectors  
- **Finance**: taxes, revenue  
- **Legal issues**: registration status  
- **Output and impact**: services, mission  
- **Management**: human resources, leadership, strategy  
- **External partnerships**: collaboration, relationships with businesses and governments  
- **attraction**: donation, volunteer, funding 
  
**Questions**  
- Can we say "growing level of commercialization"? What's the empricial evidence? If so, does it make the question more important?  
- What's the difference between "business-like" and "commericialization"?


**Chapter 1**
- P5: It is possible that competition could sharpen distinctions, leading to increasingly different market inches for nonprofits and for-profits.

- P7: when nonprofits expand, governments lose revenue. respond to erosion of their tax revenue. 
- case: nonprofits work with state government to market automobile license plates 
- entwining of mission and revenue sources 

**Chapter 2**
- ease of entry 
- bargaining power of buyers 
- bargaining power of suppliers of nonprofit inputs
- availability of substitute products or services 
- rivalry among competitors 

**Chapter 3 Multiproduct firm: a framework for choice (Burton A. Weibrod)**
- multiproduct firm 
- stepped-up involvement in commericial activities
- "commercial activities"-profit oriented actions in forms and degrees associated with private firms
- nonprofits provide: a preferred collective good; a preferred private good; a nonpreferred private good.
- revenue sources influence output decisions, and output decisions in turn influence revenue availability
- 
**Question** 
- how to measure "aggressively"

**Chapter 4 Pricing and Rationing**
- various pricing
- allocation mechanisms: for whom they do it 
- Table4.1 & 4.2 
- It is important to dertermine whether, and under what conditions, nonprofits are effective mechanisms for expressing complex social goals involving output distribution. 
**Thoughts**
  - The way nonprofits engage in commericial activities is different from for-profits. Set prices and design nonprice allocation mechanisms on a different basis 

**Chapter 5 Differential Taxation and Commericialization**
- Unrelated Business Income Taxes (UBIT); UBIT return 
- commercial share = program service revenue as a fraction of total revenue
- cost complementarities
- ancillary goods

**Chapter 6 Interdependence of commericial and donative revnues**
- contributions, gifts, and grants vs. program service revenues
- mission relatedness

**Chapter 7 Conversion from nonprofit to for-profit legal status**
**Introduction: Conversion as the ultimate commercialism**
- circumstances; assets valued; after conversion

**What**
- If the nonprofit ceases to exist, where should these charitable assets go?
- The control over assets or responsibility for liabilities
- transfer control to a private firm
- various forms: the nonprofit mutual-benefit corporation, the assets are privately owned
- conversion is a matter of degree

**Motivates**
- model organization behavior as the maximization of an objective function subject to contraints
- Nonprofits possess certain tax advantages but lack access to equity capital, and they are legally restricted by the nondistribution constraint
  (Hansmann 1980).
- Buyers might regard nonprofits as more trustworthy and prefer to purchase from them.

 **Why do conversions occur**
 - focus on the process
 - A useful working hypothesis is that changes in legal constraints or market opportunities are the primary cuase
 - Organizational goals or preferences
 - Important differences between a conversion decision and the initial choice of form.
 - The collective goods it was providing was a nonprofit are not necessarily lost in the process
