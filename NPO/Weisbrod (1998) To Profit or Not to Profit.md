**Foreword**
- Profit-making and nonprofit firms  
- Commercialization of nonprofit firms  
- Motivation: competing with for-profits; pressure from insiders to capitalize on value; desire to expand; reduction in outside support  
- Hard-to-define objectives  
- Extant but growing in significance  

**What to Focus On**
- If we write a book about the commercialization of nonprofits, what should we discuss?  
- What, why, how, so what: different stages, forms, degrees, and sectors  
- **Finance**: taxes, revenue  
- **Legal issues**: registration status  
- **Output and impact**: services, mission  
- **Management**: human resources, leadership, strategy  
- **External partnerships**: collaboration, relationships with businesses and governments  
- **attraction**: donation, volunteer, funding 
  
**Questions**  
- Can we say "growing level of commercialization"? What's the empricial evidence? If so, does it make the question more important?  
- What's the difference between "business-like" and "commericialization"?


**Chapter 1**
- P5: It is possible that competition could sharpen distinctions, leading to increasingly different market inches for nonprofits and for-profits.

- P7: when nonprofits expand, governments lose revenue. respond to erosion of their tax revenue. 
- case: nonprofits work with state government to market automobile license plates 
- entwining of mission and revenue sources 

**Chapter 2**
- ease of entry 
- bargaining power of buyers 
- bargaining power of suppliers of nonprofit inputs
- availability of substitute products or services 
- rivalry among competitors 

**Chapter 3 Multiproduct firm: a framework for choice (Burton A. Weibrod)**
- multiproduct firm 
- stepped-up involvement in commericial activities
- "commercial activities"-profit oriented actions in forms and degrees associated with private firms
- nonprofits provide: a preferred collective good; a preferred private good; a nonpreferred private good.
- revenue sources influence output decisions, and output decisions in turn influence revenue availability
- 
**Question** 
- how to measure "aggressively"

**Chapter 4 Pricing and Rationing**
- various pricing
- allocation mechanisms: for whom they do it 
- Table4.1 & 4.2 
- It is important to dertermine whether, and under what conditions, nonprofits are effective mechanisms for expressing complex social goals involving output distribution. 
**Thoughts**
  - The way nonprofits engage in commericial activities is different from for-profits. Set prices and design nonprice allocation mechanisms on a different basis 

**Chapter 5 Differential Taxation and Commericialization**
- Unrelated Business Income Taxes (UBIT); UBIT return 
- commercial share = program service revenue as a fraction of total revenue
- cost complementarities
- ancillary goods

**Chapter 6 Interdependence of commericial and donative revnues**
- contributions, gifts, and grants vs. program service revenues
- mission relatedness

**Chapter 7 Conversion from nonprofit to for-profit legal status**
**Introduction: Conversion as the ultimate commercialism**
- circumstances; assets valued; after conversion

**What**
- If the nonprofit ceases to exist, where should these charitable assets go?
- The control over assets or responsibility for liabilities
- transfer control to a private firm
- various forms: the nonprofit mutual-benefit corporation, the assets are privately owned
- conversion is a matter of degree

**Motivates**
- model organization behavior as the maximization of an objective function subject to contraints
- Nonprofits possess certain tax advantages but lack access to equity capital, and they are legally restricted by the nondistribution constraint
  (Hansmann 1980).
- Buyers might regard nonprofits as more trustworthy and prefer to purchase from them.

 **Why do conversions occur**
 - focus on the process
 - A useful working hypothesis is that changes in legal constraints or market opportunities are the primary cuase
 - Organizational goals or preferences
 - Important differences between a conversion decision and the initial choice of form.
 - The collective goods it was providing was a nonprofit are not necessarily lost in the process
  **Public Policy and Conversions**

**Chapter 9 Universities as Creators and Retailers of Intellectual Property**
- commercializing research fundings, the relationship between universities and priavte economy has changed.
- The institutional role of universities as generators and disseminators of basic knowledge
- US universities have long had a more practical orientation than universities in the UK or Germany

**Changing Role of Universities**
- a trained labor force, skilled in the newest technologies; creators and retailers of intellectual property.
- This commercialization of knowledge makes universities key contributors to economic research innovation, both as resource and catalyst (Chubin, 1994, 126).
- Universities themselves are increasingly viewed as "engines of economic development".  (Feller, 1990)
- Physical, intellectual, and economic integration between firms and universities is so pronounced that they constitute a common technological community (Powell 1996). 

**Key Factors Driving These Developments**
-The universities most involved in the new biotechnology are among the wealthiest and most prestigious research universities. 
- Established conceptions of knowledge and existing institutional arrangements no longer adequately fit with the current methods for the production and commercialization of science.
- Knowledge is increasingly located in networks of relationships, and access to such networks is a key to competitive survival(Powell & Smith-Doerr, 1994)
- A traditional disciplinary basis - Mode I; more diffuse, interdisciplinary project - Mode II

**Consequences of New Mandate for Universities**
- As universities become regarded as key contributors to economic growth, they become enmeshed in a wide array of political and economic relationships.
- earmarking spending: hard marks and soft marks -- Community Project Funding

**Thoughts**
- Under Trump Administration, how could the role of government change
- How can we understand these things from the perspective of nonprofit (The university's institutional characteristics are so dominant that they overshadow its identity as a nonprofit organization.)

**Chapter 10 Commercialism in Nonprofit Social Service**
- program fees, unrelated income
- undertake sale inititatives

**Chapter 11 Commercialism among Nonprofits: Objectives, Opportunities, and Constraints**
- Commercialism is defined to mean the degree of reliance on sales revenues rather than donations or government grants, the production of goods for sale that compete with goods produced by for-profit organizations, collaborations and partnerships with for-profits, and ultimately, conversion into for-profits.
- It is unclear whether the large "potential profits" thereby generated were used to cross-subsidize loss-making, public-consumption goods or were simply plowed back as investments to generate more profit-making goods. (This is related to Prof. Lu's paper) 
- Declines in donations, in some industries seem to be a consequence rather than a cause of the increased reliance on sales.
- Constraints and large opportunities, rather than altruistic objectives and cross-subsidization, can explain the striking emergence of commercialism.

**Theory**
- Commercialization is said to be nonpreffered by nonprofits, because it involves producing goods they dislike, or charging prices that limit the consumption of goods they do like.
- pecuniary vs, altruistic objectives
- example of healthcare
- 
**Public-policy**
- heterogenous society, no consensus on which goods and services to subsidize, votes in the form of donations.
- If benefits can be captured by prices, why should income and property-tax exemption be offered?
- The increased emphasis on sales revenues may attract more "profits in disguise"ï¼Œmanagerial selection process 
- Constraints: such as research in universities;
- Conversions: it occurs when the advantages of for-profit status outweigh the advantages of nonprofit status; who should be permitted to buy and under what procedures?

  **Conclusion**
  - For health and universities, the driving force seems to have been more basic changes in underlying institutional and economic conditions
  - When faced with large new opportunities for commercialism, many nonprofits seem quite willing to shed their altruistic cover and assume the values and behavior of for-profits. 

**Thoughts**
- use Econ model to predict nonprofits' behavior
- If there are new opportunities or fewer constraints, will nonprofits be more commercialized? 

  **Chapter 15: The Road Ahead**


  **Assessing Framework**
  - Becasue of mission vagueness, the actual goals pursued by a nonprofit may reflect managerial preferences.

  **Implication for research**
  - Different patterns of behavior across industries, can we genearlize it?
  - Nonprofits objective functions: the breadth and multiplicity of goals of indivdual nonprofits, and the differences among industries; goal of reaching particular target populations; the degree of willingness to engage in production and distribution of ancillary goods
  - budgetary constraints: the technological and market opportunities; the interdependencies among nonprofits' various revenue sources and among costs of producing various mission-related and ancillary outputs; how much and uncertainty of each revenue, the predicitability of revenue sources vary
 
  **Implications for Public Policy**
  - consensus measures of nonprofit outputs
  - Distinguish efficient resource reallocations from self-serving private gain. 
  - flexible public policy, avoiding sweeping reforms, industries having nonprofit components
  - nonprofits often see their role as performing many elements of the unfinished job of governments
  - What happens when nonprofits' pursuit of revenue drives them to act like private firms.
  - Missions of nonprofits engaged in commercial activities will grow more ambiguous through time (Tuckman, personal communication, 1997)
