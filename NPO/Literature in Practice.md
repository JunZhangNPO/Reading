## **Introduction**  
- The nonprofit "capital markets" are often irrational.  
- Personal charisma vs. strategic planning.  
- Building large-scale funding models:  
  - Developed funding from one concentrated source rather than across diverse sources.  
  - A funding source that was a natural match to their mission and beneficiaries.  
  - A professional organization and structure built around this funding model.

## **The Myth of Diversification**  
- High-growth nonprofits: 90% have a dominant funding source, which accounts for 90% of their revenue.  
- Specialization & highly skilled approaches:  
  - Not just government funding but also state government funding.  
  - Not just individual donations but also small individual donations.  
  - Not just corporate donations but also in-kind corporate donations.  
- Both the average level of diversification and the mix of funding change over time.  
- Minimizing funding risk: A single source but multiple players of the same type (e.g., different departments of the government).  
- A secondary funding source (10%) is reserved for creative work.

## **Finding the Right Match**  
- **Government**:  
  - Federal: Medical research, food, foreign affairs.  
  - State and local: Human services, employment, and education.  
- **Service Fees**:  
  - Community health clinics, student loan providers.  
  - These fees often have some government connections.  
- **Corporate**:  
  - In-kind donations such as food and medical supplies.  
- **Individuals**:  
  - Requires a clear and basic message.  
- **Foundations**:  
  - Requires a clear and expansive strategy.

## **Unlocking Growth**  
- *"We started as a charity and became a charitable business."* â€” Chief Executive Officer of the Greater Boston Food Bank.  
- Bringing in new talent.  
- Balancing passion and professionalism.  
- Focusing on financial margins:  
  - Controlling costs.  
  - Growing revenues.

## **Limits to Growth**  
- Growth is not always a choice or even a possible choice.  
- Funding for services is more available than funding for advocacy.
