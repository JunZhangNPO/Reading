# Chapter 25 Nonprofit Marketing and Branding

Marketing is defined as "serving human wants and needs sensitively" (Kotler & Levy, 1969). The application of market theories and ideas is appropriate in the nonprofit field.

- Nonprofits need to consider two constituencies: service beneficiaries and funders; two different markets: the market for resource attraction and the market for resource allocation.
- **Digital age:** Drucker (1954) defines marketing as the customer-centric philosophy in organizations' strategy and operations (Padanyi, 2008).
- Marketplace (customer, competitor, and environment)
- Market orientation
- Commercial and nonprofit organizations
- Beneficiaries/clients
- Governance is by trustees or a voluntary board of directors (Chad et al., 2013).  _This is what is different from governments._

**Questions:**

- Not because they are poor, but because they do not want to appear rich.
