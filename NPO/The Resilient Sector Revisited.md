The New Challenge to Nonprofit America 

**Introduction 
- They draw heavily on voluntary contributions of time and money, yet are expected to meet professional standards of performance and efficiency. p1
- They are part of the private sector, yet serve important public purposes. p1
- Impulses: voluntarism, professionalism, civic activism, commercialism p2
- The government-nonprofit partnerhip is responsible for the growth of the nonprofit sector. p.3
- the theme of resilience
- nonprofit America is ironically endangered by its own resilience p4
- Two competitive imperatives: survival imperative & distinctiveness imperative

**The Stakes: What Is the Nonprofit Sector and Why Do We Need it?
- Philanthropy (revenue) plays a more substantial role in expressive fields and civic affairs. 

- Functions: The service function; the advocacy function; the expressive function; the community building function; the value guardian function
- Advocacy: contribute to national life by identifying unaddressed problems and bringing them to public attention;
  a critical social safety valve, permitting aggrieved groups to bring their concerns to broader public attention and to rally support
  to improve their circumstances.
- Expressive: artistic, religious, cultural, occupational concerns; enrich human existence and contribute to the social and cultural vitality of American life
  social capital, feelings and opinions are recruited, the heart is enlarged, and the human mind is developed, only by the reciprocal influence of men upon
  one another......These influences are almost null in democratic countries; they must therefore be artifically created and this can only by accomplished by associations (Alexis de Tocqueville) p16
- The Value Guardian Function: individual intiative in the public good, the principle of individualism, the principle of solidarity. Nonprofits establish an
  arena of action through which individuals can take the inititative not simply to promote their own well-being but also advance the well-being of others. p.16
- These organizations deliver critical services, provide outlets for political expression, enrich the country's social and cultural life, promote norms of reciprocity,
  and contribute to the quality of national life in countless other ways as well.
