The New Challenge to Nonprofit America 

**Introduction 
- They draw heavily on voluntary contributions of time and money, yet are expected to meet professional standards of performance and efficiency. p1
- They are part of the private sector, yet serve important public purposes. p1
- Impulses: voluntarism, professionalism, civic activism, commercialism p2
- The government-nonprofit partnerhip is responsible for the growth of the nonprofit sector. p.3
- the theme of resilience
- nonprofit America is ironically endangered by its own resilience p4
- Two competitive imperatives: survival imperative & distinctiveness imperative

**The Stakes: What Is the Nonprofit Sector and Why Do We Need it?
- Philanthropy (revenue) plays a more substantial role in expressive fields and civic affairs. 

- Functions: The service function; the advocacy function; the expressive function; the community building function; the value guardian function
- Advocacy: contribute to national life by identifying unaddressed problems and bringing them to public attention;
  a critical social safety valve, permitting aggrieved groups to bring their concerns to broader public attention and to rally support
  to improve their circumstances.
- Expressive: artistic, religious, cultural, occupational concerns; enrich human existence and contribute to the social and cultural vitality of American life
  social capital, feelings and opinions are recruited, the heart is enlarged, and the human mind is developed, only by the reciprocal influence of men upon
  one another......These influences are almost null in democratic countries; they must therefore be artifically created and this can only by accomplished by associations (Alexis de Tocqueville) p16
- The Value Guardian Function: individual intiative in the public good, the principle of individualism, the principle of solidarity. Nonprofits establish an
  arena of action through which individuals can take the inititative not simply to promote their own well-being but also advance the well-being of others. p.16
- These organizations deliver critical services, provide outlets for political expression, enrich the country's social and cultural life, promote norms of reciprocity,
  and contribute to the quality of national life in countless other ways as well.
  
** Four Impulses Shaping the Future of Nonprofit America 
*Voluntarism 
- simpllistic folklore
- primary role is to express and inculcate velues 

*Professionalism
- By professionalism, I mean the emphasis on specialized, subject-matter knowledge gained through formal training and delivered by paid experts. p22
- The scientific charity movement sought to replace what was widely perceived to be the inadequacies of well-meaning volunteers with the "trained intelligence" of professionals.
- Professionalism creates organizational structures that are hierarchic and segmented; use a management style that tends toward the bureaucratic, formal, and rule-bound; and requires the more ample and reliable resources of government and fees for support. p24
  
*Commercialism/Managerialism
-The role that the commercial impulse presses on the nonprofit sector is a service role, but one that emphasizes managerial efficiency, innovation, and cost containment - dimensions that run counter to professionalism's emphasis, first and formost, on effectiveness. p25
- This includes the use of strategic planning, quantitative measurement of outcomes, identification of market niches, and heightened attention to operational efficiency. p26 


** The Challenges 
entitlement program, such as Medicare, Medicaid, Unemployment Insurance, and SNAP 

The overprofessionalization argument 
- Being overly professional and thus losing touch with those they serve P49
- redefine basic human needs as problems that only professionals can resolve p50 

**  The Nonprofit Response: A Story of Resilience 
- Overall sector growth: higher rate than GDP
- Commercialization:
  - A fourth manifestation of the commercial impulse in the nonprofit sector is the growing professionalization of nonprofit operations. p76
    - Three meanings: expansion of paid staff; the penetration of subject-matter professionals into leadership positions in organizations;
      managerial professionalism: managerial professionals are trained in the techniques of rational management p78
    - Penetration of the market culture into the fabric of nonprofit operations; generally incorporating the language
    - The market culture is changing organizational practices, organizational structures, and interorganizational behavior. 

**The Risks 
- Growing Identity Crisis
- Increased Demands on Nonprofit Managers
- The threat of mission creep
- Disadvantaging small agencies
- Loss of public trust

**The Road Ahead: Toward a Renewal Strategy for Nonprofit America 
- The quality of a nation can be seen in the way it treats its most valued institutions.
- Whether the balance that has been struck among the four impulses driving the nonprofit sector, and between the survival and distinctiveness imperatives that lie behind them. p112
- America's nonprofit institutions require broader support in preserving the features that make them special. P112
