**Overall** 
- historical and society level 
- an approach towards communication
- most academic knowledge and practioners' experience 

**Chapter 6**
- unrelated individuals who have common interests gravitate together to create groups and associations P.6
- Dartmouth v. Woodward

**Chapter 7**
- Seemingly inherent and self-starting developmental dynamics have included recognizing a formal practice by specialists, self-awareness of shared expertise, occupational training including pedagogy and degrees, and professional associations. P.164 
- neologism
- Hall suggested that the US nonprofit sector was only "invented" from 1950s through 1980s (1992, chap.1ï¼‰
- Conference on Association Publicity 
- Sayre had quipped that public administration and business administration "were fundamentally alike in all unimportant respects"(1958, 245)
- based on silos, rather than a sector-wide, approach 

**Thoughts**
- track the growth of a discipline from textbooks 
- practioners write textbook 

**Chapter 11 External Communication**
- PR, Journal of Communication Management
- Nonprofit Academic Centers Council
- Nonprofit PR includes: media relations; public reporting; community relations; lobbying and advocacy; crisis management p.233  
- Media relations by nonprofits can be reactive and/or proactive. p.234
- "face" and "voice" of the agency p.235
- Crisis is sudden increase of attention. P.241
- community relations refer to concontrated relationship-building and proactive outreach with a particular and idedntifiable segment of the 
  population that would have a discernible interest in something the agency's doing or planning to do. 
- NIMBY syndrom ("not in my back yard")
- Currently, it does not include organizational accountability to the citizenry as a distinct stakeholder. P.258
- In 2015, Salamon arguged that nonprofit sector was facing "a loss of public trust" (97) and that it needed to focus more on "improving  public
  understanding"(111).

**Question**
- for public-at-large who have different abilities to pay tax, do nonprofits hold different level of accountability
  
**Chapter 12 Specialized Communication: public reporting**
- accountability to public-at-large vs. well-defined or legal stakeholders
- public reporting theory 

**Chapter 13 Specialized Communication: lobbying**
- How does it feel to a politician to be lobbied? What works and what doesn't? p.265
- The predicate to effective lobbying:"See it through their eyes" p.266
- register and report (related to expenditure)
- https://ethics.ny.gov/ - Commission on Ethics and Lobbying in Government
- Lobbying Bureau
  
**Thought**
- A really good question to raise
- Similar question: how do clients feel when they know the source of service funding (more trust towards government?)

**Chapter 14 The Image in Movies 1938-1995**
- broad public-at-large
- the image of profession in popular culture
- cinematic image of the nonprofit sector in general
- maciavellian vs. collegial

**Chapter 15 Volunteer Image**
- cinematic portrayal of volunteers
- the way of management in human resources
- volunteer manager in nominal charge since 1988
- most cinematic volunteers were skeptical of volunteering intially but grew into the experience

**Chapter 16 A Future History of The American Nonprofit Sector**
- I wonder if the sector is becoming too professionalized, too specialized, too consolidated, and too dense? 326
- The diminution of volunteerism probably also reflects social trends and changes in lifestyles. p.328
- There is a need to return to people-oriented, people-based, and people-benefiting entities. p.329
- depersonalized nonprofits

**Notes**
- It is not all about professionalization, but also about history, communication, and image. 
- A combination of theoretical insights and practical experience.
