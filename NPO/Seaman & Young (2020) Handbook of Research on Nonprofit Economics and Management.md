#### *Content*
- Economic and Management Perspective 
- cross-fertilization
- experimental economics; internation area; insight from psychology

### Chapter 1: Income Diversification

#### *Where Are the Roots of the Tradition of Donating Money?*
- Sources of income: charitable giving, government support, fee and commercial income, membership dues, returns on investment, and in-kind volunteer service “income.”

#### *What We Know About Revenue Diversification*
- Utility maximization model vs. impure altruism and the warm glow factor  
- Do nonprofits prefer a mix of income sources?
  - Not universally accepted  
  - Administrative and fundraising costs vs. rate of revenue growth  
  - Views and preferences of diverse constituents  

#### *How to Conduct Research*
- Revenue concentration index based on the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index  
- As the dependent variable (DV):  
  - Mixed service → mixed revenue  
  - Without umbrella organization  
  - Older nonprofits  
  - Organizational size  
  - The field of service  
- As the independent variable (IV):  
  - Healthier financial position  

#### *Evaluating Current Research*
- Low quality and specificity: lack of data on management  
- Future directions:  
  - Resources and types of income  
  - Effects of the internet (AI)  
  - Implications of external shocks  

### Chapter 2: Revenue Interactions: Crowding out, Crowding in, or Neither 
#### *The Complexity of the Issue*
- national level; cause/sectoral level; organizational level 

#### *National Level*
- from 1955 to 2005, giving as % of GDP ranges from 1.7% to 2.3%
- the issue is complex, the strength and direction of revenue interactions vary
- theory: nash-equilibrium public good prvision; game theory 

#### *Sectoral Level*
- economic models for donation
- (crowd out >50%, crowd in >50%)


#### *Institutional Level*
- the spill over effect (Like complementary goods and substitute goods in economics) 
  

- American giving to charity has held steady at roughly 2 percent of GDP for about five decades,while both government support for the sector
  commericial revenue have risen. p.37
- nonprofit managers' strategy; donors' behavior; organizational level analysis


### Chapter 3: Distribution Policies of Private Foundations 

- a section 501(c)(3) organization whose financial support is provided by a small group of people
- the minimum distribution requirement, which requires 5% of their assets on charitable grants, dual tax rate regime 
- https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-soi-bulletins
- Non-operating private foundation, Payout rate, 5%
- a private foundation faces a 2% tax on its net investment income.
- a qualifying distribution is either a grant made to a public charity or an administrative expenditure related to the foundation's charitable activities
- grants recipients: social welfare, health, scientific purposes, education, cultural and religious purpose 

### Chapter 4: Capital Formation
- capital: as the funds gathered and accumulated for the purpose of spending on what are most frequently relatively large projects.p.59
- external capital-debt, such as bank loans, mortgage loans, municipal bonds, below-market-rate loans, loan guarantees and linked deposists; program
  related investments,
- internal capital-accumulated internally generated cash 

#### *Externally Supplied Capital*
- "pecking order" theory: an organization will have a preference for certain types of financing
- "static trade-off" theory: trade off the benefits of debt against its costs and arrives at the optimal amount of debt relative to capital stock
- These two theories come from the profit sector and could not be applied to the nonprofit setting directly.
*debt*
- a financial instrument that permits and organization to use someone else' s cash for a period of time. p.61
- inflation & real returns
- research on hospital
*Program-related investments and equity equivalents*
- capital provided by donors (typically foundations) and given to nonprofits in order to fund specific projects or programs. p.62
- count towards foundations' 5% payout requirements
- PRIs vs. traditional grant: return to foundation as some later date; specific needs, such as building credit history for nonprofits; minmize depletion of their endowment capital. p.62
- as a guarantee for a commericial loan made to a nonprofit

#### *Internally Supplied Capital*
- retained earnings
- utility of donors

#### *Previous Research*
- Debt: is the pecking-order or the trade-off theory appropraite?
- PRIs and equity equivalents: what equity means; agency problems
- Internal Capital Markets

 #### *Research Gap*
 - Why: historically not interested; no good data
 - profit maximizing paradigm
 - IRS Form contains few data on various internal projects

### Chapter 5: Asset Composition
- ennormous range and variation

 #### *What we think we know?*
*Liquidity*
- cash, cash equivalents receivables, inventory, marketable securities, prepaid expenses
- special ones: gifts receivable, grants receivable
- holding marketable securities, larger cash position than for-profits
- quick ratio: cash, cash equivalents and various receivables divided by current liabilities
- Nearly half of nonprofits have no current liabilities. p.70
- Quick assets: cash + savings + receivables; Unrestricted Quick Assets = Quick Assets - Temporarily restricted net assets
- ROA: return on assets; asset managers control risk by diversifying assets
- Data: 990 allows us to assess the balance between LBE and securities  
- The difference between assets and liabilities is net assets

*Asset Paritioning*
- Goal: to reduce the overall cost of credit when dealing with a heterogenous group of creditors
- One in ten public charities manage assets through section 509(a)(3). p.73

#### *What we do not know?*
*Ineraction of Capital Structure and Business Models*
- capital structure: a balance-sheet concept, mix of assets and liabilities; business model: an income concept, revenue creation and revenue mix
- The organization's business - in contrast to its mission - that is the key determinant of its particular asset allocation p.74
- Ownership has an impact on capital structure.p.74
  
*Restricted and Other Priviledged Assets*
- Upon dissolution, a section 501(c)(3) organization must transfer its remaining assets to another section 501(c)(3), restricting the right to alienate
- Previledged assets: may or may not be restricted in the legal sense; economic returns may be negative.
- LBE: Land, building, and equipment (LBE)
  
*Endowment and Restricted Assets*
 - free-standing endowment
 - Endowment does double duty as part of nonprofit's capital structure and as a revenue generator p.76
 - Endowment promotes equity over market efficiency and institutional immortality over market opportunism p.76
 - Intergenerational equity
   *The Perplexing Double Bottom Line* 
 - ROA: Return on Assets; XROA: External Return on Assets 
 - Bills to pay, concern with making money + public-benefit mission
 - Having two goals introduces ambiguity into decision problems, inviting inconsistent policies. p.77

#### *Gaps in our knowledge*
- Investment assets and mission-related assets
- measurement problems becasue of double bottom line illustrates
- Ideological barriers: are endowments wasteful?

#### *Future Direction*
- The temptation to form premature theories upon insufficient data is the bane of our profession. p.79

### Chapter 6: Collaboration versus Competition in the third sector 
- Collaboration is important but not popular

#### *Competition for clients when revenue is generated from prices*
- fee-based product; perfect competition model
- service maximization but not profit maximization; maximize outcomes, not profits
- cross-subsidize, suit the overall mission with a multi-product organization
- segmented market, inefficient high-cost level 
- compete by increasing cost of fundraising, trained professionals.
- the degree of market concentration;
- the potential effects on market or sector concentration of the higher fundraising costs addressed in this section 

#### *Competition for paid staff and volunteers*
- Increased salary of nonprofit executives
- managerial strategies for luring and retaining valuable volunteers
- The trade offs between pleasing the volunteer and benefiting the organization

#### *Competition for grants and contracts*
- Limited research on this topic
- insufficient money for administrative expenses contracts - a private sector subsidy of government objectives
- a bidding war, promising much and pricing their services low in an effort to win the grant or contract

#### *Competition for media coverage*
- mission involves educating the public
- clamor for media coverage to gain legtimacy in the public's mind for their mission and to attract new supporters

#### *Collaboration in the nonprofit sector*
- a continuum of collaboration
- Is "contracting" a simple exchange of funding for services, or is it more like collaboration? p.89
- share the information: associational collaboration; information about clients; trading best practices
- cost minimization: share fixed costs with other organizations; variable costs can also be reduced through alliances; fundraising events; group workshops
- Trade: differing assets create potential for trade; comparative advantage
- Bartering: occur more often in the nonprofit sector; production without cash expenditure expenditure; more collaborative than monetized trade
- Does the potential reduction in costs or enhancement of revenue exceed the transactions costs of collaborating? Collaboration takes time - the
  nonprofit manager's most precious commodity. p.92
- Improving community outcomes: why is there a need for an arranged marriage if the potential outcomes are aligned with each organization's mission?
  Each party may be unable to see directed benefits to their own organization. individual accountability vs. mutual accountability p.92
- It is the nature of the players that can make the process easy or difficult. p.93
- Strategic grant making
#### *Concluding remarks*
- external impetus for collaborative effort
- align organizational incentives with intended outcomes
- united to advocacy

### Chapter 7: Market with competition between for-profit and nonprofit firms 
- health care; credit union; day care
- economic, legal environment

#### *Reasons for implication*
- Firms to be a nexus of contracts
- nondistribution constraint: a reduced reward from skimping on quality; contraining opportunistic behavior 
- contracts based argument: nonprofits have advantage in the provision of "trust-goods"; people really care about this in some markets, such as day care
- Altruistic concern for distant others

#### *Nonprofit Incorporation and its advanatge*
- confer nonprofit status
- Historical influence
- the scope of markets in which nonprofits might choose to operate
  
#### *The coexistence of for-profit and nonprofit firms*
- scarity limits the size of the otherwise dominant organizational form
- heterogeneity in demand
- nonprofit firms as being financed and run by donor-managers
- donor entrepreneurs p.99

### Chapter 9: Modeling Nonprofit  Behavior 


#### *Concluding*
- nonprofit executive compensation and organizational performance 
- Nonprofit and product/service quality
- Data Development Analysis 

### Chapter 12: Contracting out 
- the devolution of the US government
- Charitable nonprofit organizations also contract out for services
- hire indepedent contractors or outsourcing functions
- Contracting: the design and implementation of contractal relationships between purchases and suppliers (Domberger, 1998, p.12) p.169

#### *The relative importance*
- contracting for services shows the diversity of the nonprofit sector
- infrastructure, leadership and culture influence whether to contract out core functions
- size (total revenue) matters: as the total revenue amounts went up, so did dollars spent on contracted services
- specialization: mostly IT, marketing, fundraising and management consulting
- Relationship: what to contract for and who to contract from
- The process is seamless: stakeholders are not aware of this relationship

#### *Examples*
- health organization  outsource billing and collections
- financial management services (related to the growth of donor-advised funds and venture philanthropy within community foundation)
- professional fundraisers / consultant
- higher education institutions; arts organization; museums 

#### *What we do not know*
- organizational influential factors; external environment
- consequence: accountability, relationship, performance 

#### *Questions*
- What's the boundary between contracting and buying?


### Chapter 13: Product Diversification and Social Enterprise 

- multi-product nonprofits
- the collective nature of its output
- a single product could have multi-purpose 

#### *Broadening the product portfolio*

*The framework*
- social value produced by the core product
- How might a new product addition increase the value created by a nonprofit in delivering its core mission?
- Value creation comes from the difference between willingness to pay and the sum of opportunity costs.
- new product or service comes from the central mission product of the nonprofit 

*Product extensions that raise willingness to pay*
- promote the old mission in a changed world; scalability
- production of complementary goods  
- Social Affirmative Business: use labor from disabled or disadvantaged individuals to produce goods or services

*Economies of Scope to crate value*
- use of fixed assets and in brand extension activities
- successful product extensions: the brand has strong salience & the spillovers are positive 
- reputational capital

#### *Managerial Challenges* 
- The Boston Consulting Group Matrix (BCG Matrix) / product portfolio matrix
*The earned-income vebture*
- explicit goal of raising revenues to support nonprofit operation
- Nonprofits are more labor-intensive, run with flatter organizations, use more consensus decision making and more professional reference points p.206
- unrelated business income tax

*Concluding Remarks*
- difficulty in abndoning product lines

#### *Questions and thoughts* 
- How products are upgraded


### Chapter 22: Government Funding Policies 

#### *Concluding remarks and outlook*
- bureaucratic capacity
- marshal counterfactual conditions
- the influence on board size, composition and performance. Kramer (1981) argued the constant need to raise funds can also be a source of mission deflection
- resource depedence is an issue for public as well as private funding. whether there is a "magic number" (as a percentage of revenues) at which
  an organization becomes depedent and at exactly whatlevels of government funding do which pathologies occur.
- Solution: diversify revnues
- The issue of coercive philanthropy (Brustein, 2000). Any pathologies specific to governmental funding rather than being natural results of general resource depedence.
- Vendorism; purchase of service; limited concern for certain fields: arts, education, and health literatures
- Rarely contract-based, grants or fee reimbursements are more common.
- The purpose is to enable delivery of specific, government-defined services.
- High levl of bureaucratization are required to be able to compete for contracts.
