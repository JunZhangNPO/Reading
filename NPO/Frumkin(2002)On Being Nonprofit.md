Chapter 5 Social Entreprensurship 

**Introduction**
- Fourth function of the sector: its role as a channel and vehicle for a new kind of entrepreneurship.
- Motives and characteristics of the people who lead these organizations and the tools they use to pursue their diverse and at times controversial visions.
- The barrier to entry is low.

**Elements of Theory**
- Entrepreneurs are attracted to endeavors that fit their personalities, skills, and expertise.
- A spectrum of enterpreneurial types -- one that runs from the pure "promoter" to "trustee"
- A typology of personalities within the nonprofit world: artist, professional, believer, searcher, indepedent, conserver, power seeker (Young, 1986).
- Choose activities: the intrinsic nature of the service delivered; the degree of the professional control afforded;
  the level of industry concentration; the social priority of the field (Young, 1986)
- Choose sector: the desire to realize income; the level of hierarchy and bureaucracy that is acceptable; orientation towards service (Young, 1986)
- What draws particular types of people to particular types of entrepreneurial ventures
- The features of social enterprises: demand funders sacrifice financial return, a workforce that is socially motivated, below-cost pricing to consumers,
  governed by mission considerations (J. Greogory Dees)

**Agency and the Entreprenurial Initiative**
- agency and individualism
- entrepreneurial behavior can also characterize program staff, volunteers, trustees, and donors
- Active and visible donors can make it hard to raise funds from others; raise questions about professionalism
- Venture philantrhopy; social investments rather than grants; performance measurement & quantifiable social benefits;
  lengthing of the relationship between two parties

  **Critical Perspective**
  - Will entrepreneurship lead ti over-supply or under-supply
  - The concern is that entreprenuers will select the most appealing, satisfying, and manageable projects, leaving the most difficult and dangerous work undone,
  - Entrepreneurship claims as its primary goal innovation, not equity.
  - In many cases, efficiency can be purchased only at the cost of pluaralism, diversity, and innovation.
  - Jen-Baptiste: Supply creates its own demand.
